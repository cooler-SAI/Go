Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up and Running a Beego Project
1. Creating a New Project Directory
First, create a new directory for your Beego project and initialize the Go module.

bash
Copy code
mkdir D:\Enterprise Development\Go\web_BeeGo
cd D:\Enterprise Development\Go\web_BeeGo
go mod init web_BeeGo
2. Installing Beego and Bee Tool
Next, install the Beego framework and the Bee tool.

bash
Copy code
go get github.com/beego/beego/v2@v2.2.2
go get github.com/beego/bee/v2
3. Creating a New Beego Project
Now, create a new Beego project using the Bee tool.

bash
Copy code
bee new myBeeGoApp
cd myBeeGoApp
4. Updating and Tidying Dependencies
Update the project dependencies and tidy up the Go module file.

bash
Copy code
go get -u ./...
go mod tidy
5. Running the Beego Project
Finally, start the Beego project using the Bee tool.

bash
Copy code
bee run
Explanation of Each Step
Creating a New Project Directory:

mkdir D:\Enterprise Development\Go\web_BeeGo: Creates a new directory for your project.
cd D:\Enterprise Development\Go\web_BeeGo: Navigates into the newly created directory.
go mod init web_BeeGo: Initializes a new Go module for your project.
Installing Beego and Bee Tool:

go get github.com/beego/beego/v2@v2.2.2: Installs the Beego framework.
go get github.com/beego/bee/v2: Installs the Bee tool, which is a command-line tool for Beego.
Creating a New Beego Project:

bee new myBeeGoApp: Creates a new Beego application named myBeeGoApp.
cd myBeeGoApp: Navigates into the newly created Beego application directory.
Updating and Tidying Dependencies:

go get -u ./...: Updates all the dependencies to their latest versions.
go mod tidy: Cleans up the go.mod file, removing any unnecessary dependencies.
Running the Beego Project:

bee run: Starts the Beego application. The application will be available at http://localhost:8080.
Additional Notes
Stopping the Server:
To stop the Beego server, simply press Ctrl+C in the terminal where the server is running.

Creating Controllers, Models, and Views:
Beego follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. You can create controllers in the controllers directory, models in the models directory, and views in the views directory.

Configuring Routes:
Configure your routes in the routers/router.go file to map URLs to the corresponding controller actions.
